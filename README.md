# 2048 Game in Java

This is a simple implementation of the classic 2048 game using Java Swing. The game includes basic movement and scoring mechanics, with a graphical user interface displaying the game grid and the player's score.

## Project Structure

- **Main.java**: Entry point of the application, which initializes the game.
- **game2048.java**: Main game logic, handles movement, merging, score tracking, and checks for game-over conditions.
- **Tiles.java**: Represents each tile in the game grid, with different colors based on the tile value.

## Features

- **Basic 2048 Mechanics**: Supports merging tiles, scoring, and random tile generation.
- **Game Over Conditions**: Detects when the player has won (2048 tile) or lost (no more moves).
- **Color-coded Tiles**: Different colors for each tile value to enhance the visual experience.

## Requirements

- **Java 17 or later**
- **IDE (Optional)**: This project can be opened and run in any Java-compatible IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/2048-game.git
   ```
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE
3. Compile and run Main.java to start the game

## Controls
- **Arrow keys or WASD**: Move tiles in the respective direction (up, down, left, right).
